Question 1: Do you expect the batch estimate to be exactly (-1,2)? 
Answer 1: No I do not expext it to be exactly (-1,2). This data point sample that was intended to have a sample mean of (-1,2), however the data set is created with randomness and it will vary slightly but we can expect it to be close to (-1,2).

Question 2: Which two parameters can be used to make this estimate more accurate?
Answer 2: It would be the variance, and the sample size. We could lower the variance and that would result in the data points being closer to the mean.
